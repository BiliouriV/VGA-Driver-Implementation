# VGA Driver Implementation

By Viktoria Biliouri

Implementation of a VGA (Video Graphics Array ) driver, for FPGA SPARTAN 3 console, on ISE Design Suite (Verilog). 

The following verilog files, compose the full process for the implementation of a VGA driver. 


The vga_controler.v module is the top module and the Testbench.v the tesbench file. 

vga_controler.ucf is the constraints file. 

vga_controler.bit is the bitfile that can be used for testing on Fpga Spartan 3 console.

The full process of the project is described analytically in Report.pdf
